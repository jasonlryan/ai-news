### GPT-4 assistance for improvement of physician performance on patient care tasks
- **Published**: February 5, 2025
- **Journal**: Nature Medicine
- **Authors**: Ethan Goh, Robert J. Gallo, Eric Strong, et al.
- **Summary**: This randomized controlled trial assessed whether LLM assistance improves physician performance on open-ended management reasoning tasks compared to conventional resources. The study found that physicians using GPT-4 scored significantly higher compared to those using conventional resources (mean difference = 6.5%). LLM assistance can improve physician management reasoning in complex clinical vignettes.

- **Key Finding**: There was no significant difference between LLM-augmented physicians and LLM alone, suggesting the potential for AI to match human expertise in certain medical contexts.

## AI Agents and Search

### Open Deep Search: Democratizing Search with Open-source Reasoning Agents
- **Published**: March 26, 2025
- **Authors**: Multiple authors including researchers from Sentient AGI
- **Summary**: This paper introduces Open Deep Search (ODS) to close the gap between proprietary search AI solutions and open-source alternatives. ODS augments open-source LLMs with reasoning agents that can use web search tools to answer queries. The system consists of two components: Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent.
- **Key Results**: ODS nearly matches and sometimes surpasses existing state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks (SimpleQA and FRAMES). On the FRAMES evaluation benchmark, ODS improves upon GPT-4o Search Preview by 9.7% in accuracy.
