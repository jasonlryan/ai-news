## Key Trends in AI Model Updates

1. **Reasoning Models**: Major AI companies are focusing on "reasoning" capabilities, with models that can think through complex problems step-by-step.

2. **Multimodal Capabilities**: Most new models are multimodal, handling text, images, and in some cases video or 3D content.

3. **Tiered Pricing**: Companies are offering models at different price points, from free tiers with limitations to premium subscriptions costing $200/month.

4. **Specialized Models**: Rather than one-size-fits-all, companies are releasing specialized models optimized for specific tasks like research, coding, or image generation.

5. **Context Window Expansion**: Context windows continue to grow, with Google's Gemini models offering 1-2 million tokens.

6. **Agent Capabilities**: Models are increasingly being designed to act as autonomous agents that can perform tasks independently.

7. **Competition Intensifying**: The competition between Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic is heating up, with each company rapidly releasing new models to stay competitive.
